The Seam Carving GUI is a GUI front end to CAIR[1], which is an
implementation of Arial Shamir's seam carving algorithm.

 -- A Little History --

I ran into a comment by Andy Owen re the Slashdot article about
Content-Aware Image Resizing[2] and decided his late night hack was cool
enough to deserve an easy to use interface. Besides, after a few days of
seeing the impressive demonstration video[3] about the SIGGRAPH paper on
seam carving[4] I found myself wishing I could be doing seam carving on
some images of my own.

Thus version 1 and 2 of the Seam Carving GUI came to be. Andy has moved
onto other things and I got an email from Brain_Recall (Joe) about his
work on writing a more true to the paper form of the algorithm. His stuff
looked really quite impressive so I egged him on. Once his code was
functionally complete I change the Seam Carving GUI to use CAIR for the
backend. Not only does his code work much better for stretching images
(and in general), but it's also multi-threaded and has a couple cool new
features. So with the new backend, the Seam Carving GUI reaches version
3.
