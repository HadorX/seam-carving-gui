The Seam Carving GUI is a simple GUI front end to the implementation of
the Seam Carving algorithm by Andy Owen (http://ultra-premium.com/b).

I ran into Andy's comment to the Slashdot article about Content-Aware
Image Resizing
(http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/25/1835256) and decided
his late night hack was cool enough to deserve a easy to use
interface. Besides, after a few days of seeing the impressive demonstration
video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIFCV2spKtg) about the SIGGRAPH
paper on seam carving (http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik) I found myself
wishing I could be doing seam carving on some images of my own.

Enjoy, if you have any questions or suffer from the undeniable urge to
lavishly complement this quick hack of a GUI, you can reach me at

TODO:
- Copy and Paste
- Drag and Drop
- Do any sort or optimization of Andy's image stuff
- Read the paper and make it really work!
